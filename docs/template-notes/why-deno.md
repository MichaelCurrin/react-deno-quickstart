# Why Deno?

This project consists of a simple JavaScript project which is run with
**Deno** - a fast, secure alternative to Node.js by the creator of Node.js.

You'll notice there's **no** setup of ESLint, Prettier or Jest/Jasmine as
dependencies or config file. This is because Deno can lint, format and test your
code - all without extra dependencies. It can even run and compile TypeScript
without having to install TypeScript.

For resources and guides to Deno, see

in my Dev Resources.
