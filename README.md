## Overview

- Basic **template** project so you can quickly setup your own React + Deno project, without much Deno experience.
- Use **React 17+**.
- Use **Deno** and **Make** to handle dev and production build tasks. No more Node and NPM.
- Deploys as a **GitHub Pages** static site using GitHub Actions.


## Sample usage

Start a dev server:

```sh
$ make serve
```

Create a bundled JS file to serve in production.

```sh
$ make build
```

The JS file then can be loaded the `index.html`. So you can host your React Deno application as a website anywhere such as on GitHub Pages or Netlify.
