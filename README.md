## Preview

This template project uses **Deno** to build a **React** app (no Node.js here). The app gets deployed using GH Actions and then served as a GitHub Pages site.

This is what the demo site looks like:

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://michaelcurrin.github.io/react-deno-quickstart/">
        <img src="/sample.png" alt="Sample screenshot" title="Sample screenshot" width="400" />
    </a>
</div>

## Sample usage

Start a dev server:

```sh
$ make serve
```

Create a bundled JS file of all your app code and depenendencies.

```sh
$ make build
```

The output JS file then can be loaded in the browser using [index.html](/public/index.html). Which means you can host your rendered React application as SPA web app anywhere, such as on GitHub Pages (like this project) or Netlify.


## About this template

### Overview

- Provides a basic **template** project so you can quickly setup your own React + Deno project, without much Deno experience.
- Uses **React version 17**.
- Uses **Deno** and **Make** to handle dev and production build tasks. No more Node and NPM.
- Deploys as a **GitHub Pages** static site using GitHub Actions. No manual deploy steps or server management needed.
