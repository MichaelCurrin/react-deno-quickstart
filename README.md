## Sample usage

Start dev server:

```sh
$ make serve
```

Production bundle - bundle the app as a single JS file for distribution.

```sh
$ make build
```

The JS file then can be loaded the `index.html`. So you can host your React Deno application as a website anywhere such as on GitHub Pages or Netlify.
